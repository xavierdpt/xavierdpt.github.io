The Java Security Manager API, which was present since the beginning of Java and Applets, [has been marked deprecated in Java 17](https://openjdk.org/jeps/411) and will be removed in a later version.

This is good news because this API is quite difficult to use in practice, and it is now officially not necessary to know it to understand Java Security.

And JEP 411 is an interesting read.
