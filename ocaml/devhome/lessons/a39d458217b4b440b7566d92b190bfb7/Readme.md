# Variables

A variable is an identifier which is associated to the value.

In `main.ml`, we define the variable `name` to hold the strig value `"user"`, and then use that variable to print the geeting.

We use the `let ... = ... in ...` construct for this.

This may seem of limited interest here, since the variable is used only once and is constant. It's more useful when it used multiple times, or when it is define as a function.
