# Anonymous functions

We used a function named `identity` for `scanf`, but we don't need to give such a function a name.

Here, we replace it with an anonymous function, using the `fun` keyword.

As usual, we include all the optional type information, so that you can get used to the syntax, but in practice, the type information can be omitted as long as the compiler has enough information to infer the types.
