# For loop

In this program, we use a for loop to increase the age multiple times, which runs from 0 to 2 inclusive.

The `_` syntax refers to the iteration counter. If we used it in the loop body, we would have to give it a name, but since we are not using it in this example, we have to give it this reserved name. Otherwise, OCaml will complain that the iteration counter variable is not used.
