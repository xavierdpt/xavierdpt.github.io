# For loop

In this program, we use a for loop instead to increase the age multiple times.

The `_` syntax refers to a variable that we do not need to use. If we give it a name instead, we will get a warning that the variable is not used.

Note that the for loop runs from 0 inclusive to 2 inclusive.
