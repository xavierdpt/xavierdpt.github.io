# How to print a message on the screen

This program prints the string `Hello user!` on the string.

Strings appear inside backquotes (`"`).

`print_endline` is a function that prints a string followed by a newline.

The `let () = ` syntax will be covered later.

The program is stored in the file `main.ml`.

And that's all, build it, then run it, and you should see the `Hello user!` appear on the screen.
