# Sequences

A sequence is a serie of multiple expressions separated by semicolons (`;`).

In this example, we introduce a new expression to print the age of the user.

The age is stored in an a variable `age` of type `int` using a let-binding, then printed using another invociation of `print_endline`.

Variables in OCaml are strongly typed, and there is no implicit conversion between types. To convert the integer to a string, we use the function `string_of_int`.

Note that the spacing does not matter.
